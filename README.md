# Movie Poster

### Revisited this project

Since completing this a few years ago, I decided to see if it still worked.
Alas, it did not, seems like moviedb changed their API since then.

After much Googling and Stackoverflowing, I found a solution.
For the life of me I could not figure out how to build the URL with the new changes. I tried adding the configure object into the query but that did not work.

playing around with API's playing with the movie database and making
calls to the API
